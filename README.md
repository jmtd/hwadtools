## `wadxtract`

A basic WAD extractor.

### Usage

```
$ wadxtract some.wad out-dir
```

WAD lumps are written out to files within out-dir, with filenames matching their lump names.
Lumps with the same name will overwrite each other.

A list of lumps and labels (0-length lumps) in the order they appear in the WAD's directory
is written to a file `wadinfo.txt`.
